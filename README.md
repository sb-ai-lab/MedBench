# MedBench
A **Ru**ssian **Med**ical language understanding **Bench**mark is the set of NLP tasks on medical textual data for the Russian language.

This repository contains code and data to reproduce the results of the paper [*RuMedBench: A Russian Medical Language Understanding Benchmark*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06499).

## Tasks Descriptions
- **RuMedTop3**\* is the task for diagnosis prediction from a raw medical text, including patient symptoms and complaints.

- **RuMedSymptomRec**\* Given an incomplete medical text, the task is to recommend the best symptom to check or verify.

- **RuMedDaNet** is the yes/no question answering task in the range of medical-related domains (pharmacology, anatomy, therapeutic medicine, etc).

- **RuMedNLI** is the natural language inference task in the clinical domain. The data is the full translated counterpart of [MedNLI](https://jgc128.github.io/mednli/) data.

- **RuMedNER** is the task of named entity recognition in drug-related user reviews. The data is from the [RuDReC](https://github.com/cimm-kzn/RuDReC) repo.

- **ECG2Pathology** is the task of assessment the quality of multilabel classification on ECG signals from the [PTB-XL dataset](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/).

\*Both tasks are based on the [RuMedPrime](https://zenodo.org/record/5765873#.YbBlXT9Bzmw) dataset.

## Baselines & Results
We have implemented several baseline models; please see details in the paper.

*Accuracy* is the base metric for all tasks evaluation. For some tasks, additional metrics are used:
- **RuMedTop3** and **RuMedSymptomRec** - *Hit@3*
- **RuMedNER** - *F1-score*

Test results:

We define the overall model score as mean over all metric values (with prior averaging in the case of two metrics).

\* this is implementation from the paper [RuBioRoBERTa: a pre-trained biomedical language model for Russian language biomedical text mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03951) ([repository](https://github.com/alexyalunin/RuBioRoBERTa)).

You can find the extension of this benchmark (with closed test sets) on the [MedBench platform](https://medbench.ru/).
